# Delhi_Air_Quality_data_Predication
🌫️ Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict air quality based on various environmental parameters. It focuses on predicting the pollutant concentration levels (like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.) using a dataset collected from air quality monitoring stations.

The goal is to provide early warnings and support environmental decision-making for both authorities and the public.

📊 Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature selection and engineering

Model training with multiple ML algorithms

Model evaluation with accuracy metrics

Visualization of pollutant levels

Prediction functionality for unseen data
